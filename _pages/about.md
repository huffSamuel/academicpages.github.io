Welcome to my portfolio site. If you're looking to learn a little about Samuel Huff (that's me) than stick around for a little more reading. Otherwise you can check out some of my [posts](/year-archive.html) or [projects](/year-archive.html). 

## Technology
 A part-stack (one day I'll be full stack) developer with experience with many languages and technologies including .NET, XAML, WiX, SQL, C, assembly, Flutter, and more. I'm always willing to learn a new language so just because it isn't already a part of this list doesnt mean I'll shy away from it.

## Education
I graduated from Oregon Institute of Technology in late 2016 with a Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering and an almost-Bachelor's in Computer Engineering. Instead of sticking around at college longer for the second degree I began my journey as a professional engineer. In time I hope to be able to return and finish that second major.

## Experience
I am currently a Software Engineer at Hamilton Company in Reno, NV and get to do fun things like build robots. My first job out of college and it's a success. I get to work with robots that help people (we do automated liquid handling). During college I was the team lead for the IT department's student worker group. 

## Hobbies
Living in Reno is a real blessing. While dryier than the Willamette valley climat that I'm used to, I still get to exercise my hobbies of falling off bicycles while admiring beautiful views. My wife much prefers when I hike with her as opposed to biking, I believe that it's because the risk of injury is lower when walking. Lake Tahoe is nearby and my wife and I enjoy spending time up by the water. In my free time at home I like to work on personal programming projects, most of which can be found [here](/year-archive.html) or stretching my almost-Computer Engineering degree and working with embedded electronics.
