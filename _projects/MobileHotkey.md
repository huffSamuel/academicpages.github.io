## Mobile Hotkey
[Website](http://www.mobilehotkey.com)

Mobile Hotkey is my first foray into independent application development. Install the server application on your PC, set up some macros, then use the mobile app to run those macros from your phone. Useful for tasks that typically require complex key combinations or require switching out of your current program. Using Mobile Hotkey you can switch your Twitch stream view from your phone without ever alt-tabbing out of the game.

This application is currently in closed Alpha but will be available on the Google Play store Q4 2018.
