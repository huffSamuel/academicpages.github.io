## ExifRipper
[GitHub Repo](https://github.com/huffSamuel/ExifRipper)

This is an application written for a friend who needed
to collate GPS data from a collection of images. He wrote me
asking for something that he could feed the pictures
into and get GPS coordinates out the other side (he knew about EXIF 
data beforehand).

ExifRipper currently only supports the Windows platform and will only
provide GPS data from the exif tags.
